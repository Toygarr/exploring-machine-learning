## Getting started
Name related machine learning folders include the main structures of machine learning with nice examples.\
Code files mostly accompanied by example data as (.csv). (.json converter will be added)\
Of course, after understanding these milestones, you should go through deep learning.\
If you curious about Computer Vision or NLP, check the related repos in my profile.

### Why is Machine Learning Important ?
Nvidia defines machine learning as “the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.”\
Stanford suggests that machine learning is “the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.”\
\
Whatever definition you choose, the nearly limitless quantity of available data, affordable data storage, and the growth of less expensive and more powerful processing has propelled the growth of machine learning.\
Machine learning tools enable organizations to more quickly identify profitable opportunities and potential risks.\
